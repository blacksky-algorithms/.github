### Blacksky Algorithms  

Blacksky Algorithms builds open-source, community-driven infrastructure for decentralized social media. Our mission is to empower communities with tools for safety, governance, and control over their online spaces.  

We are developing a Rust-based implementation of the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com), including a high-performance relay, PDS, and custom algorithmic feeds. Our work supports individuals, researchers, and organizations focused on decentralized identity, trust & safety, and algorithmic transparency.  

Check out our pinned repositories to see what we’re building. We welcome contributors—see our [code of conduct](https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and connect with us on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/blacksky.app).
